# ACPaaS UI - Web Components

## Introduction

Antwerp City Platform as a Service User Interface (ACPaas UI) is a **component interface library** for building user interfaces and responsive web apps. It's designed to provide developers with functionality and UI/UX patterns that matches the Antwerpen styleguide.


## Ecosystem

This library is part of [ACPaaS UI](https://acpaas-ui.digipolis.be).


## Getting Started

### Running the project locally

```shell
npm i
npm start
```

### Use ACPaaS UI web components in your project

```shell
npm install @acpaas-ui/web-components
```

> Scroll down for a list with all available components.

To integrate these web components in your framework of choice, please [follow the steps explained here](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).

Use polyfills for older browers and browsers that not support web components. To make ACPaaS UI work in these browsers, you need to include the following scripts before you load your web component:

```html
<script src="//polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webcomponentsjs/2.4.4/webcomponents-bundle.js"></script>
```

Take a look at the component documentation below to learn how to use each component.
